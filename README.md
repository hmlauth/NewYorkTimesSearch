# NewYorkTimesSearch
Obtain <em>New York Times</em> articles based on a desired search term, number of articles, and start and end years. Once you hit submit, this app takes your input values, places an AJAX call, and then retrieves data via the New York Times API. The results will be displayed for your intended purpose via a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and jQuery.

## What I Learned During This Exercise:

3. How to read documentation to properly query and then display API objects and respective data
4. How to select user input values from form input
5. How to create an AJAX request

## What I Still Need To Learn
1. How to solve "fringe" cases. For example, when the author of the article is unavailable/non-existent and therefor unable to be displayed on the page.
